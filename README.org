* App Skeleton for C++, conan, cmake and gtest


** The gist.
- This skeleton project is a jumping off point for getting started
  with a c++ project with conan, cmake and unit tests with gtest.

- source code is in the ./src dir.
- test code is in the ./test dir.

- inspect the `from-scratch` rule in the Makefile

- The from-scratch rule creates a distinct directory for build
  artifacts apart project root, this keep the project clean by
  not polliting the project with build temp files.
